(This is an placeholder README file)

This project consists of 2 parts, MVP and PyOpenGL.

MVP is my Minimum Viable Product, however it is only called that for grading purposes.
The real name is: 3D Graphics Engine from Scratch.

PyOpenGL is my attempt at a recreation of Portal, a game by Valve published in 2007.

The general theme of my entire project is 3d graphics. The techniques I use for 3d graphics are actually quite new (and by quite new I mean less than 50 years old). The most important technique is using NDC space, or Normalized Device Coordianate Space. By using a specific perpective matrix that project 3d space into a defined frustum (trapezoid-like prism), we can normalize vertices into a normalized box, and then project that easily onto a 2d screen.

To access the first part, open the Term Project MVP folder and go to the README for more instructions.

Have fun looking through my code!
